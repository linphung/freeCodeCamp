      <h3>var vs let</h3>
      <p><strong>var</strong> declares variables globally and are hoisted eg. undefined error if variable is used before declaration</p>
      <p><strong>let</strong> declares variables that are limited to the block statement and are not hoisted eg. ReferenceError if variable is used before declaration</p>
      <p>note: variables declared by <strong>let</strong> cannot be redeclared</p>
      <p>And most importantly, <strong>const</strong> are constant variables that are set to not change EVER for good reason (whatever the programmer decides that reason is)</p>
    </div>
    <div class=''>
      <h3>functions</h3>
      <p><strong>functions</strong> can be declared by the simple skeleton</p>
      <code>function foo() {
        }
      </code>
      <p>parameters need not to be declared first before using, for example</p>
      <code>function foo(param) {
        }
      </code>
      <p>multiple parameters can even be assigned as such</p>
      <code>function foo(param1, param2) {
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Printing</h3>
      <p>Depending on what language you're used to, you might expect to use the term "print" for printing out results. This is not the case in JavaScript. We use <strong>console.log()</strong> to do so.</p>
      <code>function foo(param) {
        console.log(param);
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Adding</h3>
      <p>Thankfully, JavaScript seems to have a grasp on what programmers want to do when we add things. We can add different types of numbers and strings together no problem.</p>
      <code>function foo() {
        var a = 5;
        var b = 3;
        var c = a + b;
        console.log(c);
        
        var line1 = 'Hello ';
        var line2 = 'World!';
        console.log(line1 + line2);
        }
      </code>
      
      <p>Incrementation is also very similar to other languages</p>
      <code>function foo(num){
        num++; // num += 1
        num--; // num -= 1
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    
    
  </body>
